◊h1{Setting Up a Server for My Server}

So I set up my homelab, but now I have to make it accessible from outside my apartment. Normally this is trivially done
with port forwarding rules on one's router, but my apartment building has a centralized, building-wide router from our
internet provider that I don't have control over. I could probably call and ask them to assign me a static IP address
and forward a port for met, but knowing Japan I bet they either don't allow it or hide it behind a form I'd have to
wait for them to snailmail to me, fill out and attach some residency record procured from the ward office (300 yen),
then snailmail back to them.
