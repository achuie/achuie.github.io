◊h1{What's the best way to write Nix Flakes?}

As a new convert to the ◊em{Church of Nix}, jumping straight into new-fangled Flakes seems to be the
thing to do. But everyone's got their own way of prescribing how best to structure them, and there
isn't much consensus as Nix Flakes is still an evolving feature subject to change. So just for my
sanity I'll try to inexhaustively enumerate and compare all the methods I've seen.
